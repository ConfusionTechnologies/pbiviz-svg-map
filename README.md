# Power BI SVG Map

Microsoft's [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is a dashboarding & data visualization tool for business intelligence. This repository contains a [custom visual](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/developers/custom-visualization/) for Power BI to plot data on an interactive map. This is accomplished by uploading an [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) map within the visual and configuring it with the required data.

See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/environment-setup> on how to install the environment to build this custom visual.
